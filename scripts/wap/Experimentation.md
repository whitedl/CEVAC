# WAP Experimentation
## What we want to address
* How accurate are signal-noise-ratio and received-signal-strength-indicator
  * Does this correlate well with vendor, Network, Device type, Distance,
* Can average session throughput be useful in filtering
* Can paths throughout the building be accurately measured,
* What users actually need to be counted (what measure reflects best)

## Log
### 05/30
* For a basic experiment, Drew and Harrison walked around all floors of Watt to
test how they would be tracked in the hourly CSV (3 PM)
  * We both were only picked up on a single WAP during the entire hour, meaning
	that certain WAPs are not reporting consistently, are not reporting at all, or
	are being filtered
	* We found 44 unique waps reporting during this past week, there are ~46 in the
	building (meaning the basements waps are probably not reporting)
